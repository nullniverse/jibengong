基本功 (jī běn gōng) - Practices repo

This repo name was inspired by one of the classification forms of 
the martial side of [Shaolin Kung Fu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Kung_Fu). It's my kwoon (館) for registering my daily study practices.

My current studying interests at the moment are present. There will be no index available, so check the structure of directories and files on this repo to get yourself acquainted with the content available.
